# Software Developer Skill

## Trigger
Use this skill for Huahua development tasks (implement, debug, refactor, docs).

## Single Source Of Truth
- Always read and follow `README.md`.
- If anything conflicts with `README.md`, treat `README.md` as correct and propose the smallest aligned change.

## Workflow
1. Confirm the change matches the scope and conventions in `README.md`.
2. Make the smallest working change.
3. Do a quick manual validation (MVP).
4. Summarize what changed and what you tested.
